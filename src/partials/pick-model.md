## Pick the model

1. If the request names a model (`--model owner/slug`, or a name such as "Kling" or "Nano Banana"), find it with `search_models` and use its variant for this job. Say which one you used.
2. Otherwise build a shortlist from the catalog: {{find}} Keep the models that can do what the request needs, such as {{needs}}.
3. Prefer the standard variant of a model with a fixed price at the settings you will use, so the estimate is exact. Take a specialized variant (uncensored, LoRA, custom, reference, advanced) only when the request calls for it.
4. Read your pick with `get_model_schema`: the parameter ids, options, limits, defaults and the price at your settings. Ids differ from model to model, so take them from this schema only.
5. In your cost line, also name one or two alternatives from the shortlist with their prices, so the user can switch.
